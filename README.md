# Prediction of Humidity and Temparature Data using Machine Learning.
### This project was presented as my final course project.
### The main objective of the project was to develop an incremental learning model for the prediction of temperature and humidity data.
### An ESP32 along with humidity and temperature sensors was used to obtain real data.
### During the experiments, both real data and data simulated by the prediction model were collected. The goal was to plot two graphs to compare the model's response to the real data.
### Below, we can see that in some experiments, the prediction model managed to "follow" the real values. (details of the treatments were described in the files).
